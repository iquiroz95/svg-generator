# svg-generator
Generate a svg file using Node. 

## Developer Story
As a developer, I want to be able to go into a directory of my choosing, run node on my desired file and be asked a series of questions that will take my answers as data and create an svg file. 
The generated file will be a shape of my choosing from the list the prompts will provide me. 
The color I input as my answer will be displayed as the color of the shape i chose. 
I will be asked to input a text into the center of the shape.
I will be asked to input a color for this text. 

## Installation 
This will require this install of some npm packages. 
I will need to do a jest install 
As well as a inquirer install.
